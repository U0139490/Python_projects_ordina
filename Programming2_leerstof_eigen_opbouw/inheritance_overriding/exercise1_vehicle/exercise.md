# Vehicle Exercise
Create a class called Vehicle that has the following attributes and methods:

- *brand*: a string representing the brand of the vehicle
- *model*: a string representing the model of the vehicle
- *year*: an integer representing the year the vehicle was made
- *speed*: an integer representing the current speed of the vehicle

The Vehicle class should also have the following methods:

- *accelerate*: increases the speed of the vehicle by 10
- *brake*: decreases the speed of the vehicle by 7
- *honk*: returns the string "HONK!"

Then (continue to work in the student.py file), create two subclasses of Vehicle called Car and Truck. The Car class should have an additional attribute called num_doors, and the Truck class should have an additional attribute called bed_size.
