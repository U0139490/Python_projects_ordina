# Shell Tools

This series of exercises lets you reimplement existing UNIX tools,
albeit in a more limited form.

For example, the UNIX `cat` utility lets you print out
the contents of files:

```bash
$ cat file1 file2 file3
contents of file1
.
.
.
contents of file2
.
.
.
contents of file3
.
.
.
```

There is a corresponding exercise, also called `cat`, which lets
you duplicate this functionality.
