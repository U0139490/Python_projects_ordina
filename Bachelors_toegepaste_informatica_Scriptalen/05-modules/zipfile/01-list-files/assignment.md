# Explanations

Write a script `list-files.py` that you can use to show which files are inside a zip file.

```bash
# Should print out a list of filenames
$ python list-files.py data.zip
```

Don't hardcode the zip file's name: instead, accept it as a command line parameter.

## Approach

* First, find yourself a zip file on which to experiment.
* Next, run the solution script (but don't look at its contents) on it to get an idea of what output is expected.
* Look up information about how to work with zip files in Python.
* Write your script.
