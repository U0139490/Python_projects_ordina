# Assignment

This is more of a challenge: write a function `greatest_sum(ns)` that
looks for the slice of `ns` with the greatest sum.
The result should be a pair `(i, j)` indicating the beginning and end of the slice.

For example, say `ns == [-1, 3, 5, -10, 2]`. The slice `ns[1:3]`, i.e., `[3, 5]`, has the greatest sum: `8`.
The result should therefore be `(1, 3)`.
